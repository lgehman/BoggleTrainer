This program is a trainer for the Boggle game, designed for a single player.

How to play:
A game begins when the "Start New Game" button is pressed on the left panel. A
new game cannot be started until the current game is over, which happens when
the time runs out, or the player presses the "Submit All" button (whichever
happens first). A player has 180 seconds to find as many words on the displayed
tray as possible and add them to the list on the left. This can be done by either
typing the word in the text input field under the list and pressing enter, or
selecting a string of tiles on the right with mouse left clicks and pressing 
"add" to add it to the list. If you want to deselect a tile, this is done with
 a right click. You can only deselect the most recent tile selected.
